# Repository to store code for SUNRISE student cruise paper.

Analysis code corresponding to the TXLA model may be found under 'TXLA_model'.
> There are several notebooks so far.
> - overview_figure.ipynb Makes individual subplots required for the shelf conditions overview figure
> - heat_budget_diagnostics.ipynb Computes volume-averaged and top 1 m averaged heat budgets with diagnostics from 2010. Not possible with average files because missing a $\kappa_T$, or an offline vertical temperature diffusion coefficient.
> - ts_diagrams.ipynb Makes TS diagrams for the broader cruise location with model and observational data.
< - copano.txt are the packages for our (Dylan's) conda environment if you're a python user and wish to recreate our work.
